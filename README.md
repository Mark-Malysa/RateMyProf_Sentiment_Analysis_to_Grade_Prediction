# RateMyProfessor Sentiment Analysis to Grade Prediction

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between student sentiment in professor reviews and academic outcomes by combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to understand whether sentiment analysis of student reviews can provide meaningful insights for predicting grade outcomes and improving educational decision-making.

### Research Question
*"Using sentiment analysis, what meaningful insights can be extracted from reviews of professors made by students, and to what extent can these insights be used to predict/recommend grading patterns and course recommendations?"*

## 💡 Personal Motivation & Inspiration

### Why This Project Matters to Me

As a student navigating the complex landscape of higher education, I've often found myself relying on peer reviews and professor ratings to make crucial academic decisions. The question of whether these subjective opinions could translate into objective predictions about academic outcomes has always fascinated me. This project represents my journey to bridge the gap between qualitative student feedback and quantitative academic performance.

### The Problem I Wanted to Solve

**The Challenge**: Every semester, students face the daunting task of choosing courses and professors with limited information. While platforms like RateMyProfessor provide valuable insights, they often present information in isolation - ratings, difficulty levels, and text reviews exist separately without clear connections to actual academic outcomes.

**My Vision**: I wanted to create a system that could:
- **Extract meaningful patterns** from the emotional content of student reviews
- **Predict academic outcomes** based on sentiment analysis and other features
- **Provide actionable insights** for both students and educational institutions
- **Bridge the gap** between subjective feedback and objective performance metrics

### What Drove My Research

1. **Personal Experience**: Having made course decisions based on reviews that didn't always align with my actual experience, I wanted to understand if there were hidden patterns in the language students use.

2. **Educational Technology Gap**: Despite the wealth of review data available, there was limited research combining sentiment analysis with grade prediction in educational contexts.

3. **Practical Impact**: I wanted to create something that could genuinely help students make better-informed decisions about their academic journey.

4. **Technical Curiosity**: The intersection of NLP, machine learning, and educational data mining presented an exciting technical challenge that combined multiple areas of interest.

### The Journey and Learning Process

This project evolved from a simple question: *"Can we predict how well a student will do in a course based on what other students say about the professor?"*

**Initial Hypothesis**: I believed that sentiment analysis of reviews would be a strong predictor of grade outcomes, as positive sentiment might correlate with better learning experiences and higher grades.

**What I Discovered**: The reality was more nuanced. While sentiment analysis achieved 80% accuracy in classifying review sentiment, the relationship between sentiment and grades was complex. The project revealed that:
- Sentiment scores are indeed important predictors (26% feature importance)
- But other factors like course rating and difficulty also play crucial roles
- The challenge of predicting grades from review data alone is more complex than initially anticipated

### Broader Implications

This project has broader implications beyond just course selection:

1. **Educational Data Mining**: Demonstrates how machine learning can extract insights from educational feedback
2. **Student Success**: Provides tools for predicting and potentially improving student outcomes
3. **Institutional Improvement**: Offers insights that could help institutions enhance teaching quality
4. **Research Methodology**: Shows the value of combining qualitative and quantitative analysis in educational research

### What I Learned About Myself

Through this project, I discovered:
- **Passion for Educational Technology**: The intersection of education and technology is where I want to focus my career
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: How to break down complex problems into manageable components
- **Technical Growth**: Significant improvement in machine learning, NLP, and data science skills
- **Research Persistence**: The importance of iterating and refining approaches when initial hypotheses don't pan out as expected

This project represents not just an academic exercise, but a personal mission to make education more transparent and data-driven. It's my contribution to the growing field of educational technology and my attempt to help future students make better-informed decisions about their academic journey.

## 🚀 Purpose & Motivation
