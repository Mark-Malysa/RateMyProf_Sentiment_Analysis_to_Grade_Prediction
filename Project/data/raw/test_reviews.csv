When I came in for help she did everything she could to be accommodating.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department,,,,,
 MATH131,3.5,5.0,No,"analysis is known to be one of the harder math classes and rightly so, as the material is dense and far-fetched. unless you're a hardcore theoretical math person, the material in this class seems useless and the class is painful. aksoy is a theoretical mathematician so she loves this stuff. the class is hard, but aksoy tries her best to help.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department,,,,,
 MATH32,5.0,2.0,Yes,"Im 17, have major senoritis, scored only modestly on the AP exam, and got an A in professor Aksoy?s class without much stress. And people whine about difficulty?

The trip to Sacramento is one of the best things I've done in Claremont!",Ken Miller ,Government department,Yes,Yes,,A,
 GOV20,3.5,3.0,Yes,"Miller is passionate about the founding fathers and principles, and lectures reflect that.

 GOV20,4.0,2.0,Yes,"I'm still confused as to whether he is a good professor or not. Miller is a good professor in that he's very helpful when you get hold of him and that his assignments and grading standards are reasonable. However, he has too much on his plate and is very hard to get hold of. His lectures can be boring. Not a bad professor but not the best either.",Ken Miller ,Government department,Yes,,,,
 20,4.5,3.0,Yes,Professor Miller is an extremely knowledgeable and good professor. Lectures can be slow and dry however he is extremely helpful and wants everyone to succeed and do well in his class.

 GOV117,4.0,3.0,Yes,This was easily one of the best classes I've taken at CMC. Prof Miller is a great guy and always willing to help.

 GOV117,5.0,2.0,Yes,"If you're interested at all in California Politics, take the class it's totally worth it. Even if you're not sure you're that interested, it's a great class.

 GOV20,3.0,4.0,Yes,"You must read, you must go to class, and in order to get what's going on, you should probably participate.  There is a whole lot of reading, and two papers (5 pg and 15 pg) that are required.   He knows what he's talking about and if you challenge him he might fling all of his degrees at you.  Overall he's a really great professor",Ken Miller ,Government department,,,,,
 GOV90,4.5,3.0,No,"As a non-CMC student, I can say that I felt extremely comfortable in this class. He is a brilliantly clear and comprehensible lecturer and not partisan on any issues. Very highly recommended for people interested in the constitution.",Ken Miller ,Government department,,,,,

 GOV91,5.0,4.0,Yes,"Great Professor AND Teacher. Really knows what he's talking about, and knows how to deal with confusion.

A must if you are a Gov major.",Ken Miller ,Government department,,,,,
 GOV20,4.5,4.0,Yes,"Great professor. Really interested in American Government and wants you to be too, but at the same time realizes that it is a GE. Really open to both left and right thinking.

 CAPOL,5.0,1.0,Yes,"Miller is the go-to guy on state/local gov. CA Politics is an excellent overview of the big issues facing CA, and is a must for those considering work in Sacramento (ask him about Capital Fellows).

 GOV20,4.5,4.0,,"Bright young guy, does a great job of keeping the class both currently relevant and 100% comfortable for right and left views.

 SPAN33,4.0,2.0,Yes,"Nice guy. Your grade is made up of SO many small components (homework, written tasks, pair presentation, participation) that you just have to show up and do the work. 3 midterms, no cumulative final-very reasonable. Willing to help in office hours.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,Yes,Yes,Mandatory,,
 SPAN33,5.0,2.0,Yes,Best Professor I have had at college. He really cares about you and the class environment. I am very close with everyone in that class now.

 SPAN33,5.0,3.0,Yes,"Carlos is the best Spanish professor I have ever had. He is incredibly caring and I have so much respect for him.

 SPAN33,5.0,3.0,Yes,"Such a nice and caring professor. Cares about your development in Spanish and as a person.

 SPAN125,1.0,4.0,Yes,"There's a fine line between ""it's part of the culture"" and inappropriate; the last time Gonzales saw that line, he was still living in Peru. Any time work by a female poet is read, Gonzalez lectures on how mysterious/delicate women are, and how they truly have all the power. Otherwise, he speaks mostly English in class and grades arbitrarily.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,,,,

 SPAN031,3.0,3.0,Yes,"Senor is a lot of fun. Our class was pretty tight because Gonzales is a fun guy.

 SPAN33,1.0,4.0,Yes,"unless youre interested in being taught by a guy who's less intelligible than ozzie guillen, taking this class is a waste of your time and money. flatly refuses to post anything on sakai even though he inundates you with handouts and other various junk.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,,,,

NOTE: much of the handouts he gives are missable... just do the daily work and enjoy",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,,,,
 SPAN33,3.5,2.0,Yes,"Spanish 33 was an easy class, but he's not a very good teacher. He doesn't explain a lot of things very well, but the workload is relatively light and the tests are super easy. A few projects, but he gives you ridiculous amounts of time in which to do them. I recommend this professor for span33.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,,,,

 FWS010,5.0,1.0,Yes,"Professor Schur is very clear with the layout of his grading and his course immediately. It is writing heavy, however, you are not actually graded on your writing.

Easy to do well.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,Yes,Mandatory,A,
 FWS010,4.0,2.0,Yes,"The course's structure seemed perfect for FWS: we would write 750+word pieces every week and then discuss them in class. Prof Schur's feedback is sometimes not supported by anyone else, which is confusing, but he doesn't consider it to be the only right one, so it's fine. Papers weren't graded - just write them, attend classes, and you'll get an A.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,No,Mandatory,A,
 FWS010,4.0,1.0,Yes,"Professor Schur's Writing & Experience FWS was one of the more unique classes I have taken.

He opened up as the semester went on, and seems to be a really nice guy.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,Yes,Mandatory,A-,Yes

HIGHLY recommend if you like talking about movies.,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,Yes,Mandatory,A,
 FWS010,5.0,1.0,No,"Most of his classes are discussion based, so make sure to read the material in advance. You can get by with just Sparksnoting. Bearing in mind my C+ grade, I probably should I have gotten an F for missing most classes and not handing in major assignments. His class is easy which will make you more interested in learning the material.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,Yes,Mandatory,C+,
 LIT130,5.0,4.0,Yes,Best prof I've had at CMC. Cares so much about the learning of his students. It's a challenging class but it really makes you think.,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,Yes,Mandatory,,

 FWS010,4.0,5.0,No,"It seems like participation matters in this class because he is so engaging and caring towards students, but the class is graded on 4 papers and not much else.

I honestly feel worse about my writing after taking this class.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,No,,B+,
 LIT130,3.0,2.0,No,"Very participation heavy, which I personally wasn't a fan of but many people enjoyed.

 LIT130,4.0,1.0,No,Not a bad professor. Has a little quirk and quiet demeanor to him. Likes smart students that participate with smart comments. Does not like grading so he will give work that is generally completion. Lots of reading in the first half of the class that is hard to understand. You will probably fall asleep if you're not engaged. But u won't if you are,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,Yes,Mandatory,A,
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,"I am a international student and a freshman. I definitely recommend his class. He knows how to teach and how to teach wisely about writing.

At times I was confused by his grading on certain assignments but I would definitely recommend his class,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Yes,,,,
 LIT130,5.0,3.0,Yes,"Extremely helpful professor. Go talk to him during office hours, it will be worth the time. It's easy to get a B+, but you'll have to work for an A.

 CSCI036,5.0,2.0,Yes,"Professor Cannon had a very well structured class and grading rubric. There is a lot of HW, but the class is very easy if you attention and keep up with the material.

 MATH055,5.0,3.0,Yes,"Prof Cannon's Discrete Mathematics class was very engagingshe taught the course material quite well and clearly, so I had a great understanding of the grading criteria and explanation.

 MATH55,5.0,5.0,No,"Prof cannon is a really great professor! Her lectures are clear and she explains things really well. I took her for discrete.

 RLST055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Took it for GE but Prof Gilbert totally made want to be a RLST major! Class is lecture based but he raises interesting questions for you to think about.

 FREN135,2.0,5.0,Yes,ugh: that's what i would think before each class. she's very intelligent  but intimidating. cross examines you in class whenever you comment on something and expects you to participate alot. difficult to understand her rapid accented french. massacres your essays but helps improve your writing. makes you do a 25min presentation in french. hard prof,Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department,,,,,
 FREN044,4.0,4.0,Yes,"Extremely difficult if you don't come prepared, but completely worth it in the end.

Speaking in class is mandatory, which pays off in the end (even if you don't like to be put on the spot).",Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department,,,,,
 FRENCH33,4.0,3.0,,I took Intermediate French with her and it was awesome. We learned so much about current events in the Francophone world and spoke until our lips hurt.

 FREN44,4.5,3.0,,"I don't remember Shelton being above-and-beyond-helpful as my freshman teacher, but when I've worked with her since then, she's always been MORE than happy to help.

 GOV60,5.0,5.0,Yes,Camp is amazing. He was my advisor and I took most of my gov classes from him. He's very calm and extremely wise. He helped me get my first job out of college and it's been all downhill since then--constant world traveling for my dream job. I owe so much to this man!,Roderic Camp ,Government department,,,,,
 GOVT060,4.0,3.0,Yes,"Loved this class, really interesting, and he's an awesome professor and really cool guy. But he focuses almost entirely on the developing/3rd world (his focus is Latin America)- which I found awesome-, so don't take him if you want a typical, Europe-based comp gov class. He has a very soothing, lulling voice, so be careful to keep paying attention.",Roderic Camp ,Government department,,,,,
 GOV60,4.5,4.0,Yes,"This man is shher brilliance. His comparative govt class made me switch advisors; he is also my thesis advisor.

 GOVT60,4.5,3.0,Yes,"Camp is the most pleasant and approachable prof I've had.  I didn't have a lot of interest in the subject, so the lectures and reading were a bit dull, but it's worth it.

Best part: he sometimes holds class at his house, with brownies and baclava!",Roderic Camp ,Government department,,,,,

 ECON165,3.5,2.0,No,"Professor Filson is a bit of a stickler when it comes to grading, but the coursework is interesting and he teaches it well. Tests are easy if you study, it is mostly memorization. 3 midterms and 1 paper.",Darren Filson ,Economics department,Yes,,Mandatory,,
 ECON165,1.0,5.0,No,"He pretends to have very clear grading (1-10) but in reality he takes off points without any explain for why. He  also loves to nitpick everything, if it isn't perfect and in his language it's not an A. If you do SVP, the class is a requirement which is unfortunate because he is NOT good professor and grades arbitrarily. No office hours either",Darren Filson ,Economics department,Yes,,Mandatory,B+,
 MICROA,3.0,5.0,No,"Very bad professor. His exams are nearly impossible even with studying. Prior to exams he gives sample questions from previous exams but with no solutions, making studying for them not very effective.

 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,"His lectures are very helpful in understanding the material, and he'll answer any question you have with complete clarity.

 ECONAS,4.0,2.0,Yes,The man's a decent professor.  His tests are a bit tricky because you have to put to use familiar concepts in unfamiliar ways sometimes.  That's a good thing.  Sometimes a problem shows up on the test and I just didn't expect it.  I blame myself though for not studying as thoroughly as I needed to.,Darren Filson ,Economics department,,,,,
 ECON101,2.0,4.0,Yes,Do yourself a favor. Find another professor to take 101 with. Tests are a total grab bag as to what forms of problems will be used. Does not curve. Some lectures are not only utterly incomprehensible but also completely irrelevant to the homework and tests.,Darren Filson ,Economics department,,,,,
 ECON101,2.0,5.0,Yes,"Definitely the worst professors I've had at CMC. His tests are designed to make people fail. He doesn't want to curve. He asked for an evaluation midway through the class, however, he never followed what the students said. The HW assigned is not anywhere near the material we are tested on. The only positive is that he makes extra time for students.",Darren Filson ,Economics department,,,,,

Easy to do OK, very hard to get an A.",Sylvie Young ,Modern Languages department,,,,,

 FREN22,5.0,2.0,Yes,"Best french teacher ever! She's really enthusiastic and animated about the subject matter and will randomly start singing in French during class which is really cute.
