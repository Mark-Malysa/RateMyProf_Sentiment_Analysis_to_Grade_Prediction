 HIST144,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Geismer is one of my favorite professors at CMC! I took her Reagan Era history class which obviously discussed Reagan and his policies, but looked more broadly at the culture of the 1980s as well.

There is a lot of reading and a few papers, but she's reasonable and willing to accommodate in almost any situation.

Trust me.",Lisa Cody ,History department,Mandatory,
 CALC30,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"If you have not taken calc before, I would be a little weary of taking mistry's class as he can be a bit scattered but overall, such a nice man.

Lots of music, videos, and art slideshows!",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 FOREIGNPOLICY,1.0,5.0,,,,,"Don't show your liberal side if you have one, your grade depends on it. Regurgitate passages from the reading in class and never stray from the Bush agenda. Don't talk about other foreign policy books that aren't assigned. Rude, rolls her eyes when you speak, refuses to let you talk then gives a bad participation grade. Say what she wants to hear!",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department,,
 HIST196,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I thoroughly enjoyed Prof Livesay's class. He picks some of the most interesting and relevant readings and effectively incorporates them in his lectures and discussions. His grading is fair, and he's always open/willing to help.

A very nice person but grades pretty harshly which is unfair because he is not very clear on what he wants.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,2.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,"Complicates accounting to the highest degree. Think it was impossible to be assigned a paper and be critiqued on writing ability in an accounting class?

It's not easier nor better than Massoud's class",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 RLST137,4.0,4.0,,,,,"He is one my favorite profs. I took the first Jewish-Christian Relations class and learned so much. It was A LOT of reading, but it was doable.

I've never seen someone take an easy class and make it ridiculously hard.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,
 SPAN44,4.5,1.0,,,,No,Profesora Martinez is one of the best teachers that I have ever had the opportunity to learn from. Her classes are so much fun and we talk about the most random topics.

 INTROCOMPSCI,1.0,5.0,,,,,"This is the worst class I've ever taken. His lectures are weird, scattered and confusing; the textbook is even worse.

 PHYS035,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Great online teaching, lectures are clear and interesting, relevant to homework, answers questions well.

 FHS10,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"I'm personally confused as to why Michon has a 2.8 in terms of difficulty. FHS010 was one of the most unrewarding classes I took because he essentially lectured the whole time and shut down anyone who had opposing opinions and thoughts.

 GOVT144B,4.0,4.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Sinha is a professor who cares about her students and takes the time to get to know people on an individual level.

 ECON155,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Class isn't as hard as many people make it out to be. He's a chill and really nice guy, but lectures were pretty boring and often not very clear.

 GOV020,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Bright and knowledgeable but lecture intensive, dry, boring, and too monotonous. Appears he follows the same script every year. No class intimacy or fun times.

 CALC2,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,Drop/Withdrawal,Yes,"I withdrew from the class after the second midterm and have never been so relieved.

Ultimately, this teacher is one that will take a heart attack for your education.",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department,,
 OCHEMLAB,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"As a lab prof, I would make appointments with her to ask questions and get help on reports. She would flat-out not show up to appointments and made no effort to help.

 GOV20H,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"You will sweat, get frusterated, and work your ass off at times. But you will learn so much. If you're looking for a teacher to let you sleep through class, don't pick pitney.

 PSYCH030,4.0,1.0,Yes,,A,Yes,Prof Stacey's intro to Psych class is clearly one of the best classes I have taken. Though she is a touch grader she expects her students to learn as much as possible.

Take notes!",Brian McGrath ,Literature department,,

 PHYS031,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I think Wells had a rough start to teaching and rubbed people the wrong way. I also think that people don't like physics and take it out on him.

He's a very good teacher.",James Wells ,Physics department,Not Mandatory,

 PHIL136,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Locke is great. He is a terrific philosophy teacher -- he really cares that you learn and that you understand what's going on. His ""coach"" attitude towards philosophy is helpful for non-majors. He's funny and acerbic, which makes classes fun. No, he's not that easy, but if you were looking to coast thru college, you would have gone to Pomona.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 BIO43,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"wonderful, sweet woman, but a truly awful teacher. She is one of those people who just has no teaching abilities.

 FHS10,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Although at times the class was disorganized and had a lot of work, she is an extremely caring woman and if you get to know her (go to her office hours!) she will be very helpful.

 GOV151,3.0,5.0,,,,,"i think he's senile or just lost it. your final grade has nothing to do with the class. it's amazing how he even comes up with these numbers. you learn a lot in the class, which is great and simulation is fun. however, it's really not worth the absurd ending.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 BIO43,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"She comes across as a really nice lady. Don't let the smile fool you. She believes that everyone took AP Bio when we all didn't.

It's up 2 you. Read the book tho",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department,,

 CHEM116AND15,4.5,2.0,,,,,"His teaching style suited me perfectly for ochem but, when I had him during his one semester of teaching gen chem, it didn't transition over very well.

 CHEM14,1.5,2.0,,,B,Yes,"Boring lectures. He makes fun of people and answers questions with rhetorical questions.

 BIO43L,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I just had him for lab and he gave very detailed lectures at the beginning of each lab (which would make lab take a long time).

 FWS010,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Professor Lobis is a very helpful professor. He responds to emails very promptly. His class can be kind of boring but his friendliness makes up for it. He isn't too difficult of a grader. I would definitely take another class from him.,Seth Lobis ,Literature department,,

Plus, he is more than willing to help anyone out during office hours.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON50,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Very enthusiastic Econ 50 professor. Take this class if you want a good understanding of the basics of Economics. He will bend over backward to show you how to understand something, and is almost always available for help outside of class.

 GOVT149,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Very knowledgeable and extremely kind, but better as a mentor than a professor.  He's forgetful, picky, and kinda random.  Assigns TONS of reading and papers and grades very hard, you have to do *exactly* what he's looking for.  He'll read drafts of papers, which is helpful.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 PSYC01,1.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"You may not have any other options, but avoid this professor if you can.

 PSYC93,3.5,5.0,,,,,Psych is such BS!,Shana Levin ,Psychology department,,
 CSCI145,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Literally the worst professor and class I've ever had. Lectures and notes are messy and confusing, and he can't explain the simplest of concepts.

 GOV143,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Don't let my ratings fool you; I thought she was a great prof. She wasn't a pushover like many of the profs here.

Ugh.",James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 GOV145,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B-,Yes,Took two of her classes in one semester and it was brutal. Probably some of the most work I have done in a Government class.

 PHIL1,4.0,5.0,,,,No,His class is the best I have taken at CMC. He is thought provoking and wants his students to explore the issues raised and to further understand their own beliefs and opinions. He produces good philosophers.,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 GOVT122,2.0,2.0,,,,No,"Never has someone conveyed so much information without saying anything. her lectures were basically her talking about how much experience she had in the business world. her expectations were always unclear and graded inconsistently. every class ran at least 5-10 min past the end time. it was a fair amount of work, and i'm not sure what i learned.",Constance Rossum ,Government department,,

Prof Branch uses slack very well too and the readings are well selected.",Jordan Branch ,Government department,,
 GOV020,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Professor Blitz was a good intro to gov prof, but his lectures were very long and dry (this does mean you don't have to do your reading outside of class though).

 FHS,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,"He is the worst teacher ever. He only accepts his own opinion and allows for no discussion in class he doesn't agree with.

",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 LEAD10,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Gave a 1 because the system doesn't allow for 0.

She is SO focussed and helpful, and has a clear direction when it comes to how she wants the semester to progress, with a really good balance of discussions, lectures, papers and a three-class simulation at the end of the semester that replaces the final paper. Class is challenging but worth it. Highly recommend her.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,

 GOV151,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"U.S. Israel and Arabs is definitely worthwhile if you are interested. Otherwise, it would be painful. 3 10 page papers, weekend simulation, and you have to occasionally lead class.

Somewhat intimidating though.,Marion Preest ,Biology department,,
 ECON171,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"I would recommend Prof. Evans for any class because of how clear, organized and helpful she is, but especially for environmental econ because of the optional (really) extra materials and readings she provided in an attempt to make the subject relevant.

 HIST169,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Professor Kalb's Global South Asia class was the HIGHLIGHT of my semester.

 FHS2010,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Overall a great classroom experience.

Definitely do not recommend.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department,,
 LIT162,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,One of my favorite lit classes I've taken so far. The readings were really interesting and engaging.

 RLST055,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Took it for GE but Prof Gilbert totally made want to be a RLST major! Class is lecture based but he raises interesting questions for you to think about.

He is super helpful if you go to his office hours to talk about paper or before midterms.,Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 FHS10,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,The class was very unorganized and her grading policy is unclear. Intense amounts of reading in an unreasonable amount of time.

 RS37,1.5,3.0,,,,,"Ok this man doesn't know what day it is. All he talks about is how great Sweeden is and how much he wished US students were like they are 'back home'... please.

 PHIL100E,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Very thoughtful person who pushed me to become a better thinker and a more competent philosophy student.

 RLST166B,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Religion, Politics, and Global Violence was hands down my favorite class of my senior year.

 GOV70,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Extremely intelligent and knowledgeable. Great at fostering discussion and really teaches IR theory well while keeping it interesting.

 MATH131,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Do not take. She is a very nice person but not a good teacher. All these reviews are saying her lectures are unclear but that's ok?

 PSYCH37,2.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Riggio's lectures consisted of odd stories from when he used to work as a consultant and arguments on why psychology is actually harder than real science.

 DANTE1,5.0,5.0,,,,No,"Prof Meyer is a very eccentric prof, no doubt about it. She is also very serious about lit, so if you take her class take it seriously.

One of the hardest and most stimulating lit classes I took at CMC.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,

He's super nice and the midterms and finals are exactly like the homework assignments.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 USCONG,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Like Prof Massoud, Prof. Pitney is one of the institutions that make CMC what it is. If you are a Gov major, you must take his class.

 HIST100,1.5,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Professor Lower seems like she would be a good researcher, but did not run her class very well.

Only assignments are two 20 page papers (but he actually wants 30+pgs- he cares about length and # of citations not quality) and 1 debate (on paper topic). No need to read, but helps with papers. Class could be much better, but hes an old guy stuck in his ways",Frederick Lynch ,Government department,,
 PHIL030H,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,"Locke is phenomenal. I took his Honors Philosophy class as a GE and loved it!

 FHS010,3.5,3.0,,,B+,Yes,"She is extremely disorganized; I cannot emphasize that enough.

 GOV80,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,A provocative professor who doens't act like a professor. Nadon adopts whatever the view of the book he assigns and never gives his own views.

The accounting concepts are not difficult and they are important for upper level accounting classes.,Joshua Rosett ,Economics department,,
 MATH31,5.0,4.0,,,,,"Great math professor, only problem is that he is rather hard.

Stellar, 10/10",Derik Smith ,Literature department,,
 GOV149,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Koch has been my favorite prof I've had in college. She's so incredibly smart and passionate, but so willing to break down concepts for the class.

 ECON101,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"She's a nice person, but was largely unavailable for extra help when needed.

Every CMCer needs to take  a Massoud class before you graduate. ECON 86 is an awesome class.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department,,
 PHIL30,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"5 Exams worth 10% each, 2 four page papers worth 15% each and 5 reading responses. If he doesn't agree with your argument be ready to expect a B.

 INTROPSYCH,2.5,1.0,,,,No,"If you're looking to get an easy A GE out of the way, intro psych with reed is the way to go. The class is really easy, but she is an awful teacher that teaches down the material so much so that going to her class is an annoyance. She means well, but her class is a glorified daycare full of powerpoint heavy lecture and condescendingly slow pacing.",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department,,
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Busch always seems to be in a good mood and because of this gives interesting lectures.  Very easy to pay attention in his class.  Really hard to get an A, but an A- or B+ is completely feasible if you put the work in.",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 PHIL136,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Professor Locke is an EXCELLENT professor - one of the best I've had at CMC. His classes are certainly difficult but worthwhile. He grades you hard throughout the semester to push you, but his final grades are very generous. If you actually want to learn something and improve, take his class.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 FWS1,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"He goes out of his way to make the subject interesting and make himself available outside of class. You really have to work for an A, but when you do, you learn a lot. He'll make you a better reader/writer. His feedback is sometimes longer than your entire essay, and it's because he truly cares about helping his students learn.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,Mandatory,

 HIST059,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I learned a lot from Prof Wang; she is extremely knowledgeable about what she teaches. As an intro course, the grading was pretty formulaic. If you do the reading, you can easily do well. Her lectures were very informative and interesting enough to keep me engaged. She always came off as nervous when lecturing, but I think that's just how she is.",Chelsea Wang ,History department,Mandatory,
 LIT10,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Warner is a captivating lecturer, very clear about the class and requirements, and really  makes it hard NOT to see him outside of class to help with your writing. He is indeed a tough grader but it's reasonably fair since he is upfront about raising the bar.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 ECON86,5.0,4.0,,,,,"THE best econ prof at CMC! Don't be turned away by the difficulty of the class, you will learn a huge amount in his class. Massoud is the most caring and nice professor in the world, and he will work very hard to help you succeed. If you get a bad grade it's your own damn fault.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department,,
 GOV20,1.0,4.0,,,,,"By far the most overrated prof at CMC.  Pitney is all vague talk.  He didn't actually teach gov, we just discussed books.  He's actually pretty easy because he only gives B's on papers, even after telling us 500 times how he will mark our papers to hell.People just say he's great because it's trendy",John J. Pitney ,Government department,,
 ECON102,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"It's an interesting class however slightly unpredictable, his exams are usually much harder than practice exams. Though he grades blind (and fair). There is no way to guarantee a good grade in this class, just try to understand everything",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 HIST186,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Prof. Cody is the absolute best. I have never had a more caring and passionate professor. She will do anything for her kids and knows her subject in mind-boggling detail.,Lisa Cody ,History department,,
 FREN044,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Extremely difficult if you don't come prepared, but completely worth it in the end. She will make you work for the grade, but she's a phenomenal professor who will make you a better student guaranteed. Speaking in class is mandatory, which pays off in the end (even if you don't like to be put on the spot).",Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department,,
 FWS,2.0,3.0,,,,No,This class does not improve your writing at all. I learned more in my 45 minute sessions at the writing center than I learned in his class all semester. He's a boring teacher and unhelpful at his office hours.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,

 RLST136,5.0,5.0,,,,,"This man is the hardest and best professor I've had so far.  He will make you work more than you've ever worked before, but he makes it worth your while and fascinating.

 GOVT149,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,I really enjoyed Professor Favretto's class. It was not very difficult but the content was interesting. The class was lecture-heavy and your grade depends on only two tests and one paper. An A is definitely attainable.,Katja Favretto ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,4.0,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Very nice man. Writes amazing recommendations, so get to know him. Intro level gov class- His lectures could be boring at times, but hes clearly interested in the subject matter.  Participate for the debates and do the readings for the daily quizzes. An A is not impossible.",Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 ECON102,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,He rocks,Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,
 GOV130,1.0,4.0,,,,,"He requires a lot of writing (4 papers with a 10-15 page final paper and an exam) He is not helpful. He doesn't check his e-mail and he isn't very prepared for class. His grading scale makes absolutely no sense. For an instutution that prides itself on quality, he is most definitely a weakness.",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 PSYC37,2.5,3.0,Yes,,B-,Yes,"Not sure about the good reviews below. Riggio was okay, a very average professor that I wouldn't mind taking again for a class I don't care for, but not a professor I would take again if I had another option. Boring class overall but it wasn't the hardest thing.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department,,
 BIO80,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"A great teacher. The class is hard though, although the bad grade was largely my fault. She holds really fun labs that make it interesting for a non-science major, unlike pretty much all the other science courses you can take here. And they're usually short--another plus.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,,
 MATH031,4.5,3.0,,,,No,"He's a terrific professor if you're willing to learn the material. Doesn't use the book much and is super enthusiastic in class. Whether you enjoy the course or not, it's hard not to like him",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department,,
 ECON50,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"She teaches ONLY from PowerPoint slides, which is incredibly frustrating. She doesn't explain how to do problems, so the tests are kind of shocking- you feel like the questions have come from nowhere.  She is very nice, just not my best teacher.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ARTOFATTENTION,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"I understand why Leland has gotten average ratings, as he is a very difficult grader and expects a lot from his students. However, as a Lit major, he has inspired me to be a better writer and look for art in everything I see; what more can you ask of a professor?",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 CS62,1.0,4.0,,,,No,I used to love CS. Now I dread the subject. Homeworks take forever and he doesn't understand that we have a life outside of his class. His exams test you to see if you can be a compiler. Useless.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 PHIL90,4.5,1.0,,,,,"Very interesting course. Great person. Not lots of work, but lots of thinking. I learned a lot.",Jefferson Huang ,Philosophy department,,
 FHS10,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Class was entirely discussion based.  Assigned absurd amounts of reading.  Impossible to get a decent grade on essays - even if you show him your essay beforehand and do everything he tells you to do, you'll get a mediocre grade at best.  Avoid at all costs.",George Thomas ,Government department,,
 RLST21,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"On the one hand, the final project for this class was the most work I've ever done for a homework assignment, and took more time than some of the other entire classes I've taken. On the other hand, I told him I was going through a rough patch and he gave me an extension to the end of the semester no questions asked. Would recommend.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,,
 CIV10,4.5,2.0,,,,,Unbelievable professor. Makes class a lot of fun and is an interesting professor. Not too bad looking either-and he likes the Dodgers,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 PHILOFRELIG,3.5,3.0,,,,,"I often felt as though he was trying to be openminded, but was just failing at it.  It becomes clear eventually that he's a pretty conservative Christian and that just biases him too much.  He is pretty nice, though.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL100E,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Kreines is amazinghe has a real commitment to make the classroom environment and his pedagogy as inclusive as possible, and does his best to simplify the complex concepts that are part of his class. He has gone above and beyond his duties as a professor, even sending me additional readings outside of class that connect to my discussion posts.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PSYCH141,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"The class is GREAT, the professor so-so. His reviews all remarked how preferential he is towards males, which is tough in a participation-heavy class, and we struggled with his lack of clarity of assignments (and making 60% of our grade due the week after thesis!). That being said, the class is AMAZING, one of the very best, just be prepared!",Jay Conger ,Psychology department,,
 RLST087,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Take a class with Prof Gilbert!! He is insanely knowledgable and very unbiased in his teaching. This is honestly one of the best classes I've taken in college. Clear expectations, reasonable but not easy grading, gives extensions if needed. Lots of reading but don't need to do most, take good class notes though and don't miss class. Learned SO much",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Not Mandatory,
 BIO44,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,Personally I enjoyed her class. She was really helpful outside of class and would always go the extra way to help you understand a concept you didn't understand. Plus there's tons on extra credit literally like 10% of your final grade because she accepts tests corrections for partial credit. I would take her again.,Princess Gilbert ,Biology department,Not Mandatory,
 PHIL030,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Awesome. Take her class. She is very smart but also fun and loves her students. She brought us pizza multiple times. I want to take another philosophy class because of her.,Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 LITSECT,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I'm not a lit major but I've taken several lit courses bc of Meyer.  Despite what other negative comments there might be, give her a chance.  She doesn't demand much of you and she usually only assigns short essays.  She gets incredibly excited about the topics and (if you try some) you'll get excited too.  She's brilliant and awesome!",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 PORT001,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,I loved this class and Norman so much! Participation is super easy and the workload is super manageable making it a really fun class.,Norman Valencia ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN125,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"There's a fine line between ""it's part of the culture"" and inappropriate; the last time Gonzales saw that line, he was still living in Peru. Any time work by a female poet is read, Gonzalez lectures on how mysterious/delicate women are, and how they truly have all the power. Otherwise, he speaks mostly English in class and grades arbitrarily.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Pears is the perfect Gov professor to take if you are an international student or don't know anything about American Politics. Her classes are mostly lecture and discussion based, but will sometimes throw in a cool activity. She is a normal grader- leaning more towards tough than lenient. There is a lot of reading so be prepared for that.",Emily Pears ,Government department,Mandatory,
 MATH031,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Yes, he allows notecards, but doesn't really teach the material. Does too many problems on the board during class for my taste.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 FEMINISTTHEORY,5.0,4.0,,,,,"She has one of the largest cult followings at CMC. She's a hard grader. Her office hours are jampacked.  That said, she's incredibly, incredibly nice and down to earth. Go chat with her just for fun (if there's not a huge line).",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 HIST130,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Class was awesome!  I loved it. We went in depth about topics (NOT wars and stuff).. why war crimes? does army change you? recruitment?  great topics.  There is a lot of reading because you NEED to talk as this is a seminar.  1, 5 page paper a week too!  so it's a lot of work and you need to participate. harder than i thought",Robert Kirkland ,History department,,
 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Very interesting class from which I learned a lot especially because I didn't have an Econ background. Olfati is funny and makes the material as interesting as possible but it is Econ and you can expect a few long boring problem sets in lectures. Very difficult to get an A because she insists only 95%+ receive A's and not 93%+. Quizzes are a breeze,Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 PHIL030,5.0,3.0,,,A-,Yes,Professor O's class literarily is the class that makes me fall in love with philosophy. She is very helpful and engaging. The structure of the lecture is extremely clear. The workload is much lighter than I expected. The average reading volume is about only ten pages. But it is true that you need to pay a lot of attention to it. TAKE HER CLASS!,Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 HIST100,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Johny is a Greek God. He convinced me to take a history dual with my major. He is by far the most helpful prof at CMC if you visit his office hours (He's always available) and will help you with outside-class stuff too.   LOTS of reading though. 200 pages a week for my class. But totally worth it.,Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department,Mandatory,
 ISRAELANDARAB,5.0,4.0,,,,,No Comments,Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 CIV10,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"If you aren't looking forward to taking Civ, take nichols. He doesn't hold you responsible for the reading and he is an easy grader. The assessments are reasonable and infrequent. The class is pretty boring, but it is important to go. Just regurgitate the lectures in your papers with a little extra insight and you'll do really well.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 GOV80,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Nadon is either the worst professor you've ever taken or the best -- I tend to err on the latter side, but I could see how one could find him offensive. Personally, I thought he challenged me on my own beliefs and helped me gain a better understanding of political society. In my opinion, he's thought-provoking, but he's not everyone's cup of tea",Christopher Nadon ,Government department,Mandatory,
 CHEM014,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Hurlocker was one of my favorite professors. I took both semesters of Intro Chem with her and they definitely required hard work but she was organized and did a good job going through material.

 MATH30,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Nice guy, but gets lost easily, often creates too tricky examples that even he can't work through.

 BIO043,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"She is pretty lecture heavy, but the content was interesting and she keeps the class engaged with plenty of time to ask questions if you're confused.

 FHS10,4.5,2.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Though not as prominent academically as some other religious studies teachers at CMC, Michon's passion and knowledge of the coursework made every class interesting and engaging.

He always smiles!",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department,,
 ECON50,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Prof. Fernholz just reads off the slides which you have access to on Sakai so you don't really have to show up.

 GOV60,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I love this man!  Professor Camp is genuinely one of the nicest professors I've ever met, and truly wants students to learn.  His class is interesting and very pertinent.

 ECON122,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,The lectures can get a little boring but otherwise the class and prof Gelman are great! Tests are not that hard and they don't make up a lot of your grade.

 BIO143,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,He is a really nice man. Generally not the hardest class but it was often confusing as to what was expected.

Often the textbook was too hard / too in-depth and was not helpful.,Patrick Ferree ,Biology department,Not Mandatory,
 LIT10,2.0,3.0,,,,,"This was a bad class. Prof. is very defensive and at times hostile, rejecting students ideas that don't line up w/ her own narrow, feminist, anti-male perspective.

Great intro to journalism; don't be intimated if you have no experience.,Terril Jones ,Government department,Mandatory,Yes
 ECON086,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,"He is easily the worst teacher I have ever had.

Study the practice exam!!",Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM14,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Hatcher Skeers is a very good teacher. Although the tests are tough, if you do the assigned readings and assignments, it isn't that bad.  Your grade defenetly reflects how much work you put into the class.",Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department,,
 LIT130,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Extremely helpful professor. Go talk to him during office hours, it will be worth the time. It's easy to get a B+, but you'll have to work for an A.

 PHIL030,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Most amazing professor I have ever had. She is extremely helpful and will do anything she can to help you understand the material.

 FHS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Professor Antill was a great FHS teacher. Class was Faith and Reason and he really knew how to analyze religious arguments.

Without question, she goes above beyond the requirements of her job.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 BIOL80,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Coleman is a wonderful professor, and makes the class extremely fun and interesting. The tests were also interesting though. They always felt really easy, but it did seem like she would take off points just to get you down to a certain grade. It was almost like your grade was predetermined. Besides for that, great class and fun professor",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"He seems really hard but once you get used to his style of teaching, you learn sooo much. At times he is unintentionally intimidating but hes a nice guy really.

Best forthe long run",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,

 HIST100,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"My favorite class in college so far! Class was entirely based on discussion, so be ready to have an opinion.

 HIST90,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,"We had to play this ridiculous and grueling role-playing history game to pass this class, which pretty much sums it up. Just skip this professor. As stated, grading is very arbitrary. Do not take unless history major and are very very committed to the field.

 GOV105,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I took Org. Health Care/Public Policy with Prof Lynch which was one of my favorite courses by far at CMC.

 ECON129,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Prof. Raviv teaches game theory very abstractly, and you are forced to learn the material through extremely difficult problem sets and past midterms that don't accurately affect the upcoming ones. The grade breakdown was: 20% problem sets (5), 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 40% final. This was not good, considering the raw average on mid2 was a 58%.",Yaron Raviv ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,

 GOV80,3.5,1.0,,,,,"Long, droning lectures are a bit difficult to get through, but you have GOT to go to class to do well in this class.

Still, learned a lot and he will help you out if you ask for it.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,,
 CHEM116L,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Professor Mackey's could be a little clearer in lecture. Often he gives a lot of examples but doesn't really explain the grand scheme of things.

His tests are fair, but a lot of learning is done outside of class, as is expected with Organic Chemistry.",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 LIT165,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof. Shelton is obviously so intelligent and passionate - that being said, she did not handle the transition to online learning that well.

 ECON150,2.5,3.0,,,,No,"Didn't like his teaching style. Really liked the 5 quiz system. Didn't like the online portion of the class.

 ECON86,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I had no real knowledge of accounting before this course. I got a good amount out of the material and am glad that I took this class.

Overall good course",George Batta ,Economics department,,
 GOV101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I took Professor Pitney's class as a freshmen over 20 years ago. I had no interest at all in government at the time and have since become a doctor.

 ECON180,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"econ 180 is the seminar that goes with thesis. burdekin is the nicest guy in the world, and he's always willing to help. a lot of professors at cmc make you see them in person before they'll be helpful at all, but burdekin reads through e-mails and replies thoroughly. that's amazingly convenient and it shows how much he cares about his students!",Richard Burdekin ,Economics department,,

 MATH30,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not a good professor. He wants you to understand, but his teaching style isn't good. His midterms are hard and he doesn't curve the class, so no only is it hard, but its also tough to do well in.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,,
 CIV20,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Aimaq took a required GE and turned it into one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I have taken at the 5Cs.

 PHIL106,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I took FHS and Kant with Kreines, and I must say they are by far the best courses I've taken.

 GOV20,3.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,Really nice and interesting person. I recommend you go to lunch with him when he offers. There's a good amount of reading in the beginning but it gets easier.

Real-world application. If you try, you should at least get a B.",Mary Evans ,Economics department,,
 GOV70,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Branch was new this semester & was amazing; he brings a younger teaching style & perspective that I felt I didn't get with other gov profs.

 MATH050,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"very nice and friendly guy! math has always been my least fav subject but he was super helpful in office hours.

 BIO43,5.0,4.0,,,A,Yes,"Wiley is a great teacher, incredibly enthusiastic, and someone you will want to do research with after her class. That being said, she is hard.

 PSYC081,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Kanaya is hilarious and quirky (in a great way) - I will really miss classes with her. Classes are interactive and feel like a direct dialogue with her.

Only in his first years, but still needs to improve.",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department,,
 PHIL30H,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Professor Kreines is awesome. He sincerely cares about you and your thoughts--he's the type of person to get at the content rather than focusing on how you frame it or other trivial things.

 ECON101,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Professor Bjerk is probably one of the best professors I've had at CMC. I went into this class knowing NOTHING about econ (I didn't learn anything in econ 50), but Bjerk taught concepts from the basics. He's clear and effective. If you do the weekly homework (4ish easy problems), online readings, and actually study for midterms, you can get an A.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 CHEM116L,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A+,No,I absolutely loved Neeraja!  She was very helpful and extremely available for extra help and would clarify something for you as many times as it would take you to understand it (very helpful for ochem).

Very very willing to help, but his explanations were circular and not helpful",Yaron Raviv ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 RLST143,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Davis is a GREAT lecturer and is always open to comments/questions, which he answers with clarity and respect.

 LIT62,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Awesome prof in class - one of the most intelligent at CMC.  The workload in Shakespeare was very realistic and graded fairly.  The final exam, on the other hand, was TOUGH.

 GOV91,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Great Professor AND Teacher. Really knows what he's talking about, and knows how to deal with confusion.

 FWS010,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Don't take his FWS. He is a nice guy, genuinely I like him as a person. However, as a teacher, he is quite vague with what he wants (as in no prompts), especially in terms of essays (which are 5 pages). I haven't learned anything in terms of being a better writer, which makes the class a waste of time.",Robert Von Hallberg ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 ECON135,4.5,3.0,,,,No,Professor Burdekin is a very intelligent and articulate teacher.  If you do not pay attention in class your notes are meaningless once you get around to them.

He is really cool.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Love her! She's the sweetest prof and you can tell that she loves what she teaches.

Highly recommended for non-econ types.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department,,

 RLST153,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not my favorite professor. He did not guide discussion well, he assigned a TON of reading and writing, and did not seem responsive to his students. He is knowledgable about the topic for the most part, but I did not enjoy the class",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 GOV020,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Prof. Busch is amazing. He is so sweet and I loved his lectures (his Gov 20 class isnt really discussion based).

 CALC30,5.0,3.0,,,,No,The absolute best professor ever. I hate calculus but ended up with an A in his class because 1) he makes sense 2) he's fair 3) he's very approachable and it's easy to get out-of-class help with him 4) he's clear about his expectations. If you have to take Calculus you should only do it with professor valenza!,Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department,,

 196,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Econ 196 was the best class I've taken at CMC. Even though the subject matter is extremely difficult, Professor Shelton takes them time to make sure everyone is on the same page. This is an excellent class that gives you the opportunity to understand growth, pricing, the business cycle, and unemployment at a much more advanced level than 102. ",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 FWS1,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"If you want to become a better writer, take Prof. Warner. His feedback can feel nit-picky, but it is always specific and helpful. He invests time in his students. Class was a mixture of lecture and discussion with some really great handouts.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 ARBC033,4.0,3.0,,,A,Yes,"Fantastic professor. Her class can certainly be daunting, but she also definitely means well. She is very friendly and willing to help. I have taken two classes with her so far and both have been very challenging but equally helpful. Study hard, ya shabab. You need to understand   what she's teaching in order to succeed. I recommend office hours.",Ghenwa Hayek ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 CS55,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,Just avoid him. Lectures never make sense. Huge calculation on exams with unfair grading. He uses his body to cover the broad when he explains problems. The whole class are constantly confused and he is arrogant if you ask him too many questions. It's a pity that a liberal art college has class like that.,Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department,,
 GOVT060,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I definitely recommend taking Aseema's GOVT060 class! She is a sweet and bright lady. She is always willing to help and she never forces you to participate in class, though she has room for class participation (i.e. its not all lecture). Her tests are not hard - she focuses on important concepts not trivial details.",Aseema Sinha ,Government department,,
 PRINCOFPHIL,3.5,4.0,,,,No,I actually really liked this class and I think he genuinely made me a smarter person. The workload isn't bad- you write a one page paper each class but it's usually just a reflection and he doesn't want you to take more than 30 mins on it. Plus 3-4 major papers. Taught me a lot. And go to class to discuss or else you won't get participation points!,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 GOVT155,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I don't know why Prof. Uvin has low reviews for his freshman seminar courses, but in his area of interest, he's amazing.

 ECON86,3.5,5.0,Yes,,,No,"In class professor Massoud is great! He clearly understands the material and explains it well, but when it comes to test he can be unfair. There will be aspects to questions that would have not been addressed. Also, MAKE SURE TO GET OLD TESTS! He midterms and final are from prior years. ",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department,Mandatory,
 BIO43L,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"She's pretty terrible. Assigned at least 50 pages of reading in the textbook each week. Doesn't curve her tests, even though everyone failed the second one. Exams are extremely difficult and she likes to pick random buried facts from the text and test you on them. Avoid at all costs.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department,,
 CHEM116AND117,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Awesome experience, loves his subject, and it shows!He teaches you how to critically think, instead of sheer memorization.  Learn the concepts and you'll do well on the tests...that's it, plain and simple.  Takes a lot of time to do practice problems, but my friend and I did ****loads of practice probs and the tests were easy,nothing unexpected.",Kersey Black ,Chemistry department,,
 RLST156,1.0,3.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,Does not care about your time or money. ALWAYS LATE to class and her lectures were not always well-planned.

 FHS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Kalb was the highlight of my semester, she's the best! She's extremely kind and you can tell she really cares for her students and the content she's teaching.

Her essays can be tough but worth it!",Emma Kalb ,History department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,The class attendance was optional and every day was just lectures never did worksheets or activities (so it was boring). Professor Lincoln is very helpful during office hours! Exams were difficult! Make sure to do the practice problems regularly after every lecture (even though they aren't required) so that you can apply what you learned.,William Lincoln ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,

 LIT063,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Literally one of the most (if not THE most!!) kindest, caring professors at CMC.

She made the online learning format enjoyable, which is a feat in itself.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 CALC1,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Professor Valenza is amazing. His tests are super easy and he is a good teacher. Will never forget how he explained calculus using arts such as famous paintings. Really changed my perspective on math.,Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,

 BIO43,1.5,4.0,,,,,"AGAIN: Don't take her if you don't have to. Course is a waste of time and you will come out of class with no understanding of the material. Poorly organized structure, poor communication, and little grasp of the class dynamic. Two thumbs down.",Irene Tang ,Biology department,,
 CALC32,4.0,3.0,,,B+,No,"Great teacher as long as you go in with an open mind.  His lectures are very wordy but it helps a lot when looking over your notes. Its easy to get a B in this class but hard to get an A. Overall great teacher, he will even let you text him questions about the home work.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 ,2.5,2.0,,,,,,Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,"I heard people suggest me not to take his class but it turns out to be the BEST class I had in CMC. It's totally Ok if you don't understand stuff in class, just go to the office hour. He can't be more helpful and caring. He gives me wise life advices and makes me think deeper in econ. If you are really in to econ, take him!",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,

 ARBC001,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I cannot possibly put into words how fantastic a professor that Bassam is. My favorite professor of ALL TIME and not even an Arabic major The only caveat is that he has very high expectations of all his students. But if you are passionate, the man has seemingly infinite time, capacity, and desire to guide you in learning this awesome language.",Bassam Frangieh ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 HIST152,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Amazing prof. I had her for Art and Politics; it is one of my favorite classes at CMC so far.

A lot of reading but if you commit the time, you get so much out of it!",Lisa Cody ,History department,,
 HIST149,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Professor Selig is awesome.  She's warm and funny and easily approachable. She's passionate about the material and helps her students to be as well.

She's definitely one of the coolest professors I've come across at the Claremont Colleges.,Diana Selig ,History department,,

 ECON101,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,Worst professor I have ever had. All he did was talk about how we didn't know enough math. He doesn't use the textbook hardly at all and his tests come out of nowhere. Plus he's hostile at his office hours. I regret taking the class 100%. Take Bjerk instead...,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 CIV10,5.0,2.0,,,,,"The only way I know how to describe this class is this: the other morning, I was reminded that Civ10 with Valenza is just a semester long course, not the full year, and I actually teared up. You will learn about yourself in this class. Priceless!",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department,,
 ARBC001,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Bassam made me feel like our class is really a family. He's one of the funniest, kindest, and sweetest teachers I've ever had, though his class can be a little chaotic or confusing at times.

Be sure to take advantage of the tutoring hours outside of class.",Bassam Frangieh ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 BIOL80,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Coleman is fantastic! I took neurobiology with her for the GE, and even though I didn't enjoy the subject material, I learned a lot. Professor Coleman is kind, funny, and clearly passionate about science.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Uvin (former Dean of Faculty which is why he has so few ratings) is amazing! It's about development. Participation, 2 short papers (very easy), a class that you plan (pretty easy), and a longer final paper (easy bc lots of time to do it). Interesting, not long readings, and the papers are analyzing interviews and data. Highly recommend this class!",Peter Uvin ,Government department,Mandatory,Yes
 RLST166B,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I can't stop taking his classes. Readings are engaging, relevant, and the subject matter is controversial as ever, what an exciting course! RPV is the best class I took in college and opened my eyes in ways never thought imaginable. Very committed to building his dept and making sure his students come away having learned more. Take his class!!",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department,,
 PSYC070,3.0,5.0,,Yes,,Yes,Take his classes if you are a psych major - you will learn a lot. His classes are not for the faint of heart; you could study for 10+ hours and it will still be hard to get an A or even A- in the class. You are graded on like 3 tests and a couple short mini papers and one long paper but he is a tough grader on all of those things.,Daniel Krauss ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 CHEM14,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,do not take this class. it made me hate chemistry. i put a ton of time and effort into this class and it didn't pay off. class just made the material more confusing and he expected you to know material he didn't teach nor was in the book. worst professor ever. nothing about this class was good.,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,,
 GOV20,3.0,4.0,,,A-,No,"Professor Lofgren is a very intelligible man who has a hard time displaying the information to his students in an interesting way.

 CSC040,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,This course is difficult- don't get me wrong. But it would probably be easier than equivalent courses offered at HMC or Pomona. Our assignments helped build out our Github while being useful/practical. Mike clearly states that it will take 12 - 15 hours of work a week for an A- and that's pretty accurate. Put in the work and go to tutoring!!,Michael Izbicki ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON50,2.5,4.0,,,,No,"Uses math exclusively to teach concepts.  I didn't put a whole lot of work in to the class, but I really studied for the last test and did well.  If you're willing to do outside work to study and are good with math, you'll do fine and learn some.  Funny, but digresses into material of 101.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 PHIL033,5.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Schroeder is the best philosophy prof. Took him for Political Philosophy and we had interesting lectures, papers, and discussions.

 ECON086,1.5,4.0,,,A-,Yes,"His lectures don't contribute to the tested material at all. He likes to talk about accounting and its uses, but rarely teaches the fundamentals and expects you to be able to complete the homework by learning the material yourself.

 PHIL034,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Frigault is super interesting and he made our 8am worth getting up for. Before each class, you have a 10-20 page reading and you answer 4 questions (2-3 sentences each) about what you found interesting + questions you have about the reading.

 MATH31,1.0,5.0,,,Pass,,"He wrote the textbook, so if you don't understand his lecture, you won't have a chance. He is a condescending prick that actually made me cry in class.

 FHS,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"The only discussion based class I had freshman year. I didn't take a single note.

 ART7224,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"He is a great professor very kind easy to understand it is a hard course but if you read the book it's not as hard.

The stuff he talks about in class is exactly the same as in the text.",Deepak Shimkhada ,Religion & Philosophy department,,
 HIST100,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,This class is unlike any other at CMC. The war simulation is so elaborate that many non-majors were drawn in.

His grading is not as tough as students may think it is at first. ,Ian Hopper ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS10,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Her FHS Nature and society class was super interesting and engaging in my opinion (discussions about native land, and colonialism).

 ECON150,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Magilke is definitely one of the hardest professors at CMC and while he makes you study a lot on your own, it forces you to learn accounting.

 PHIL136,4.5,4.0,,,,No,Professor Locke is an amazing Professor.  It is true that he has high expectations but his goal is not to weed people out of his class.
